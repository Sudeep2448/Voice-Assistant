*Installing Google Calendar API:
   pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib (Run this in anaconda or python prompt)

I have added 3 events on November 9 , 10 and 11 , 
  you can check by telling that date and month in running script , 
    you will get know the events.
    
 Fake Google account:
    gmail :- projectrevahack@gmail.com
    password :- projectrevahack@123
    
 you can login with these google credentials in google calendar and add few more events ,
 and then try to run the script .
 Spell , on which date and month you have added the event and script will tell event name and time.
 
 While running the script make sure you have good internet connection.
